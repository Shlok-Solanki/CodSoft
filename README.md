# 🎯 CodSoft Python Projects (Internship)

This repository contains Python-based desktop applications developed as part of my internship at **CodSoft**. These mini-projects showcase hands-on learning and implementation of GUI development using **Tkinter**, as well as fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, randomization, and event handling.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1. 🕹️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Tkinter GUI)

A classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user can play against the computer in an interactive desktop GUI.

#### 🔧 Features:
- 🖱️ User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
- 🤖 Randomized computer moves
- 🧮 Score tracking (User vs Computer)
- 📢 Instant result display after every round
- 🔄 Replay functionality with a single click

### 2. 🔐 Password Generator (Tkinter GUI)

A secure and customizable password generator that allows users to create strong passwords with a single click.

#### 🔧 Features:
- 🖼️ Interactive GUI built with Tkinter
- 🎛️ Adjustable password length
- 🧩 Option to include uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
- 📋 One-click copy to clipboard
- 🔁 Instant regeneration of new passwords

### 3. 🧮 Calculator (Tkinter GUI)
A user-friendly desktop calculator application built using Python’s Tkinter library. It supports both basic arithmetic and scientific operations like square root and power functions.

### 🔧 Features:

## 🚀 Getting Started

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

To run the scripts:
python game/game.py
bash
Copy
Edit
python password-generator/password_generator.py
These are standalone desktop applications and do not require any external libraries apart from tkinter and random.

## 🧠 What I Learned
During this internship, I:

Gained practical experience building GUI apps using Tkinter

Understood the importance of clean and modular code

Strengthened logic building and control flow handling in Python

Developed confidence in converting basic concepts into interactive applications
